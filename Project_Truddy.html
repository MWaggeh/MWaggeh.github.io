        <p>We have all been in the situation where we've wanted to travel to a specific destination with some friends, relatives or our couple but it seemed impossible or hard to get them to go due to factors such as budget, time of the year or desirability of the place to visit, because hey, we all have our own lives and schedules.

      <h6 class="whitetext subheading"> THE CASE</h6>
      <p class="whitetext"> A few months ago, I was having a conversation with my colleagues during a lunch break about holidays, it came as a surprised that, sometimes, many of them had it hard to go to some destinations because they had no one to go with. In terms of people, they were referring to their friends, family or couple. It was quite interesting because we have it easier than ever to travel for affordable prices so I thought, why not try to go with other people?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <div class="container spacing">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h6> <b>User research</b> </h6>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12" >
          <p> To dig deeper into this matter and get measurable data to validate my idea, I conducted a survey to ensure this was a real problem for a significant number of people and I got some interesting findings out of 61 respondents:</p>
          <img src="./imagenes/Survey_Results3.png"  class="d-inline-block img-fluid" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-12" >
            <p>Also:</p>
            <img src="./imagenes/Survey_Results2.png"  class="d-inline-block img-fluid" alt="">
          </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12" >
          <p> Interestingly, about 21% of the them said they would go on a trip with new people/strangers and about 33% would consider it:</p>
          <img src="./imagenes/Survey_Results.png"  class="d-inline-block img-fluid" alt="">
        </div>
 <div class="col-md-12">
   <p>To understand more about these users perceptions and why there was an important percentage (33%) that was dubious about it, I performed 4 semi-structured interviews with 4 of those respondents to help me understand their underlying concerns regarding my idea as well as 3 other interviews with people that responded that they would likely go for it to understand their motivations: </p>
   <p>I put the findings on notes to help me identify patterns which helped me gauge important pain points and opportunities for the ideation process:</p>
   <img src="./imagenes/Affinity_Diagram.jpg"  class="d-inline-block img-fluid" alt="">
 </div>

  <div class="col-md-12">
       <p> So I concluded that this set of dubious interviewees were concerned about not knowing the other people’s interests, personalities’ and way of living before considering them compatible to travel with and trusting them.
        I used these insights and turned them actionable in order to try to also target the more reluctant people.
      But before that, I created an Empathy map to try to empathize more with these people:</p>
  </div>


<div class="container spacing">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h6> <b>A framework to define opportunities</b> </h6>
      <p> </p>
      <img src="./imagenes/Empathy_Map.png" width="100%" class="d-inline-block img-fluid justify-center" alt="">
    </div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="container spacing">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h6> <b>User persona</b> </h6>
        <p> This helped me defining and shaping my main target who would be a user with the following set of traits: the more adventurous type looking to go outside of his/her confort zone. This is someone who is willing to give it a chance as long as they have the opportunity to know their potential travel buddies before.</p>
      <img src="./imagenes/User_Persona.png"  class="d-inline-block img-fluid" alt="">
    </div>
</div>
</div>
        
<div class="container spacing">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12" >
      <h6> <b>PROBLEM</b> </h6>
      <p> From here, by putting all of these insights together, I was able to understand the problems to address: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Lack of trust to travel with new people due to unfamiliarity </li>
        <li> Compability concerns</li>
      </ul>
       <p> So to tackle the identified issues, I thought of the following solution: </p>
       <ul>
        <li> Add a filter so that only users with similar characteristics can join the user.</li>
        <li> Provide an internal chat where users can get to know each other and generate reliance. </li>
        <li> Add an itinerary planner to keep the engagement going and make it more exciting & fun to organize. This will also help revealing personality traits of each member and, thus, ensure members are compatible.</li>
       </ul>
    </div>

      <h6> <b>Conceptualization: Paving the way to a MVP</b> </h6>
      <p> Now, focusing on the design of the App, and considering what would be the core values of it, friendship & trust, I defined this information arquitecture after using the card sorting method to help me figure the organization of the app's information:</p>
      <img src="./imagenes/Information_Arquitecture.png" width=100% height=100% class="spacing" alt="">
    </div>
</div>
</div>


<div class="container spacing">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12" >
      <h6> <b>First prototype</b> </h6>
      <p> Based on the information arquitecture and other methods such as the user flow diagram, I did some sketches and turned them into this prototype in order to test the main features: Adding a new trip applying filters, and chatting with travel buddies to organize the itinerary of a scheduled trip.</p>
      <img src="./imagenes/Prototype.png" width=100% height=100% class="spacing" alt="">
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="container spacing">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12" >
      <h6> <b>Validating the product</b> </h6>
      <p> To make sure the design was valid, I conducted a test with 4 testers. From the results, it was clear that the idea of having the 2 key features (the chat and the itinerary planner) integrated within the chat was an utter disaster, 3 out 4 of the testers were not able to guess how to access the itinerary planner to complete task 2, and only managed to get there with trouble. I thought I had a great idea but it seems like it wasn’t or maybe I failed at the information arquitecture. </p>
      <p>The percentage of participants who correctly achieved the goal was 1 with difficulty, it was a critical error.</p>
     <img src="./imagenes/Test_Results.png" width=100%  alt="">
     <p>To reduce the learning curve and design the information in a more logical manner, I had to simplify my workflow so I next iterated on the design and modified it.</p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>

 <div class="container">
   <div class="row">
     <div class="col-md-12" >
       <h6> <b>New design</b> </h6>
       <p> In this new design you can see how I included the itinerary within the trip file as it seemed to make more sense and removed it from the chat. In a second testing round users managed to easily complete the same task:</p>

       <h6> <b>UI DESIGN</b> </h6>
       <p>For the design of the visuals, I started off with this moodboard which helped me setting the tone of the App. Based on the values of friendship and trust, I decided to go for blue-green and orange hues to convey trust, security & serenity (blue-green colours), strong emotions, youthful & fun (orange colours).</p>

     <div class="col-md-12">
       <p> In terms of typography, after many combinations, I decided to go for "Simplifica" for the App title and "Montserrat" for the rest, because of its clean, modern and easy to read design. </p>

        <h6> <b>Key Takeaways</b> </h6>
        <p> Some of the most important takeaways from this project were the incremental improvements I achieved through iteration.</p>
        <p>I also learned about the importance of usability testing in early stages. In a fast working environment, where agile methods are implemented and product features need to be released in short schedules, it is crucial to work in rapid iterative cycles and obtain rapid feedback to make decisions. </p>
        <p> And also, how important is it to consider success metrics when testing products to help with decision-making.</p>
