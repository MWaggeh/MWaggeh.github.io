Even though NWI had many years of experience in the wellness field, their program had been slow to catch up with technology. They had seen a substantial drop in memberships and wanted to find a way to add value to their members.
            So the task to be completed was to:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create a digital wellness tool for their clients</li>
              <li>Update their image - create a new visual system that reflects their innovative and refreshed approach to wellness. </li>

          <p> I first had the idea to focus on a growing specialized market, vegetarian, because of its proliferation and its impact on the food industry. It would be an App especifically designed to help vegetarians achieve their fitness goals via a <b>nutrition tracker </b>. The project has been designed following a design-thinking methodology that is built from 5 pillars: </p>

          <p class="whitetext"> To begin, it is important to develop an understanding of your target user's issues, and in order to do so, I did and initial background research to understand more about their fitness & nutrition habits. For that, I conducted surveys (24 vegetarians) and also 4 interviews to help with some insights.</p>

   <p>Although the survey and interviews results showed the majority of vegetarians who responded do like taking care of their health & fitness, the interviews revealed a major concern regarding my idea: tracking the nutrients you consume may be good but it can turn into an obsessive behaviour, to a point that you stop enjoying the simple fact of working out and being vegetarian.</p>
